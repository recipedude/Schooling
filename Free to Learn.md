### Concepts

Age of 4 children has developed judgement. Free to run with other kids.

Childhood doesn’t end until they have their own kids.

Spoiling, letting children explore/be free spoils kids? Nope, opposite. Bright, well adjusted 


Today in modern education we don’t beat children like in the biblical old school systems, we drug them, or shame them

Schools we more worried about reading the wrong stuff, by directing can help to control thought.

If the goal were to encourage critical thinking and diversity of thought one would never model a school system the way modern schools are organized that explicitly indoctrinate and foster obedience.
