### Concepts

Age of 4 children has developed judgement. Free to run with other kids.

Childhood doesn’t end until they have their own kids.

Spoiling, letting children explore/be free spoils kids? Nope, opposite. Bright, well adjusted 


Today in modern education we don’t beat children like in the biblical old school systems, we drug them, or shame them

Schools we more worried about reading the wrong stuff, by directing can help to control thought.

If the goal were to encourage critical thinking and diversity of thought one would never model a school system the way modern schools are organized that explicitly indoctrinate and foster obedience. 

Home directed self directed education 

Can make friends easily, able to look adults in the eye

Optimal context for self directed education 


Agile learning centres

Need to trust

Need time to be bored, time to go down various roads, learn the tools (like computers)

Mixed age group is critical and a variety of adults

Age mixing is the key, instinct to play is mixed age - provides the opportunity to be boosted up to the younger child and the opportunity to cultivate leadership in the older children
